# Flutter To Do App

This is a simple to do app built in Flutter.

It relies on an external REST API built on Laravel which can be accessed at [laravelreact.com](http://laravelreact.com). The source code for that project is available at [laravel-react-bootstrap](https://github.com/devinsays/laravel-react-bootstrap).
